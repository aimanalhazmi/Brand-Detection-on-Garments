# Brand-Detection-on-Garments
This project is my bachelor thesis on logo detection on garments using deep learning. It combines the Grounding Dino model for logo localization and ResNet50 for logo identification. The findings highlight the potential of deep learning for automating brand logo detection, with insights for retail and e-commerce applications.
