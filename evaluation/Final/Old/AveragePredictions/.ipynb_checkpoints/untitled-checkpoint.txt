The accuracy of your model is low due to several potential issues:

1. **Class Imbalance**: It appears there is a significant class imbalance in your dataset. Some classes have very few instances (even zero), which makes it difficult for the model to learn to classify them correctly.

2. **Insufficient Training Data**: For classes with very few examples, the model doesn't have enough data to learn from, leading to poor performance on those classes.

3. **Model Complexity**: The model might be too simple or too complex for your data. If it's too simple, it won't capture the necessary patterns. If it's too complex, it might overfit to the training data and not generalize well.

4. **Feature Engineering**: The features used for training might not be sufficient or relevant for the task. Proper feature selection and engineering are crucial for improving model performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The model's hyperparameters might not be optimized. Hyperparameter tuning can significantly affect the model's performance.

6. **Data Quality**: There might be issues with the quality of your data, such as noise, missing values, or incorrect labels, which can negatively impact the model's accuracy.

To address these issues, consider the following steps:

1. **Address Class Imbalance**: Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE) to balance the classes.

2. **Increase Data**: If possible, gather more data, especially for classes with very few examples.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to improve the quality of input features.

4. **Model Selection**: Try different models to find one that better suits your data. Ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can be particularly effective.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for your model.

6. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean your data to remove noise and handle missing values appropriately.

Implementing these steps should help improve the accuracy of your model on the validation set.
